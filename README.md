A blockchain is an open, immutable, peer-to-peer network. It is most commonly thought of in conjunction with cryptocurrency and NFTs; however, the technology is also being utilized for other purposes such as IoT devices.

#### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts ####

Smart contracts are code deployed to the blockchain to help developers and users Read/Write information on a particular blockchain. They are powerful but brittle.

A smart contract is similar to a global static OOP class. There are a few important distinctions, such as how smart contracts are instantiated and stored on the blockchain. Once a smart contract is deployed, the information is there forever. The contract information and methods can be made inaccessible if the contract is designed with a "self destruct" catch in mind.

#### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction. ####

In the context of Cadence & the Flow Blockchain: Scripts have read access and are free. Transactions have read/write access and require someone to pay a gas fee.
